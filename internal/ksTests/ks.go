/*
Calculates the Kolmogorov distribution function,
which gives the probability that Kolmogorov's test statistic will exceed
the value z assuming the null hypothesis. This gives a very powerful
test for comparing two one-dimensional distributions.
see, for example, Eadie et al, "statistocal Methods in Experimental
Physics', pp 269-270).

This function returns the confidence level for the null hypothesis, where:

	z  = dn*sqrt(n), and
	dn = is the maximum deviation between a hypothetical distribution
	     function and an experimental distribution with
	n  = events

NOTE: To compare two experimental distributions with m and n events,
use z = sqrt(m*n/(m+n))*dn

Accuracy: The function is far too accurate for any imaginable application.
Probabilities less than 10^-15 are returned as zero.
However, remember that the formula is only valid for "large" n.
Theta function inversion formula is used for z <= 1
